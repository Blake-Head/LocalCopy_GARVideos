    "Here I am attempting to write a step-by-step basic tutorial for how manim animations are set up, manipulated, and called.  This is based on how I (Blake) understand the system as of late 2024.  More than likely, my process is not the most efficient, but should get us going.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am writing this in a Jupyter notebook, which is just a file that can contain multiple blocks of different code and words (like here).  I think you should be able to open this and run chunks of code locally within the notebook.  This way, you don't need to set up extra bits of computer environment to test and learn the basics of Manim.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first block just below this is a starter command that (I think) just checks your system to ensure you actually have manim installed.  If you don't have manim installed, this block will show an error below, saying something to the effect of \"No moudle named `manim' \".  If you have manim, nothing notable should happen here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also shows you how we will always be loading in the manim library.  This is all done in Python, with manim just being a library of tools within python.  The * symbol means \"Take every single tool from the manim box out\".  Sometimes, it's more efficient to only import the tools you know you'll be using rather than the entire library, but manim is small enough that we don't care.  "
