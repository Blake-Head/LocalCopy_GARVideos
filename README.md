This is a repository for the purpose of storing and collaborating on physics video lecture projects at Texas A&M University - Commerce.

Located here are (or will be) folders containing animations using the python library "Manim", as well as test / model code for training and learning purposes.  Additionally, there will eventually be areas where new members to the project can follow step-by-step tutorials for how to create animations in python, and hopefully also how we edit those things into videos.

The motivation behind this project is to create high quality, engaging, and informative physics lecture videos that leverage research from cognitive psychology.  In a flipped classroom environment, students ideally should be spending time in class working through problems as groups, rather than listening to lectures.  If students can watch a reletively short, but interesting video prior to class, much more content can be covered in course, and a better level of understanding / comprehension can be reached. 

And also, it just seems cool to do.

To get familiar with the kind of style we will be aiming for, I would reccommend you watch a video or two from these two channels:
