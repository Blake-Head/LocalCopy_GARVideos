This is a repository for the purpose of storing and collaborating on physics video lecture projects at Texas A&M University - Commerce.

Located here are (or will be) folders containing animations using the python library "Manim", as well as test / model code for training and learning purposes.  Additionally, there will eventually be areas where new members to the project can follow step-by-step tutorials for how to create animations in python, and hopefully also how we edit those things into videos.

This is a test edit.
